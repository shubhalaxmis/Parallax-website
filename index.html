                Adventure is a mental encouragement. It involves adventurous tasks that are wilfully chosen by an individual. Every person needs some break from the busy life. He/she looks around for the activities that can add some thrill to life. Adventurous activities like Mountaineering, Hiking, Sea Walk, River Rafting, Trekking, Bungee Jumping, Scuba Diving, etc are some of the adventures that can add some thrill to a person’s life.
                <br> <br>
                Finding delight in a smaller part of life can be an individual’s adventure. Like, arranging a road trip with family or friends can be called an adventure. Encountering activities that involve physical danger, as well as mental satisfaction, are adventurous activities. A famous quote by Helen Keller says that “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing”.

Whether you’re navigating rugged mountain trails, cruising along coastal paths, or meandering through charming countryside villages, each turn brings new sights and experiences.
                <br><br>
                The sense of freedom and connection with nature is unparalleled, as you discover hidden gems and breathtaking vistas that are often missed by car.

                The paraglider wing or canopy is usually what is known in engineering as a ram-air airfoil. Such wings comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to form a row of cells. By leaving most of the cells open only at the leading edge, incoming air keeps the wing inflated, thus maintaining its shape. When inflated, the wing's cross-section has the typical teardrop aerofoil shape.
                <br><br>
                In most modern paragliders (from the 1990s onwards), some of the cells of the leading edge are closed to form a cleaner aerodynamic profile. Holes in the internal ribs allow a free flow of air from the open cells to these closed cells to inflate them, and also to the wingtips, which are also closed.
